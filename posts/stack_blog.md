# 🧠 Stack Operations That Made Me Feel Like a Genius (After Feeling Like a Fool First) 🤦‍♂️➡️😎
### **NSE, PSEE, NGE, PGE — The Four Horsemen of Stack Glory 🐎🔥**

Alright folks, gather around. Today we are diving into the **legendary world of stacks** — a place where logic lives, errors haunt, and your self-confidence gets punched and hugged at the same time.

This is the story of how **NSE, NGE, PSEE, PGE** almost turned me into a motivational speaker… out of pain…  
but then lifted me like **Rajinikanth’s slow-motion entry**. 😎🔥  

Let’s begin.

---

## 🤝 The Beginning: Me vs Stack
When I first heard words like **Next Smaller Element**, **Previous Greater Element**, I legit thought:

 “Bro, why are we comparing exes here? Just let the past go da.” 😭

But no.  
Turns out it’s just DSA… but with attitude.

I entered that chapter like a hero…  
and got slapped by stack operations within 5 minutes.  
But don’t worry — now I’m the one slapping back. 💥

# 🔥 1. NGE – Next Greater Element
**Meaning:**  
For every element in the array, find the **next element on the right** that is greater than it.

In simple language:  
 “Who is the next guy that flexes more than me?” 😎

**How we fail initially:**  
We loop from left → right  
We compare every element with every other  
We get TLE faster than you can say “Leetcode123”.

**How stack saves us:**  
We go from **right → left**,  
use a stack to keep only the “useful heroes”,  
and discard all the weaklings on the way.

**Harvey Specter explanation:**  
 “Win a case before it even starts. Remove unnecessary people before they waste your time.”  
That’s exactly what stack does. ✨

---

# ❄️ 2. NSE – Next Smaller Element
**Meaning:**  
Find the next element on the right that is smaller.

AKA:  
 “Who is the next guy shorter than me?” 😌

Approach is the exact sibling of NGE.  
Just instead of greater → look for smaller.

And the cool part?  
When you understand NGE properly,  
NSE feels like copying homework and just changing names. 😭🔥

---

# ⏳ 3. PGE – Previous Greater Element
**Meaning:**  
Look LEFT and find the element that is greater than the current one.

It’s literally NGE… but the camera turned 180 degrees. 📸

And bro…  
first time I learned this I was like:

 “Array la pakkathula irukura number ah patha podhuma? Why reverse, why stack, why stress??”

Then stack said:  
 “Because I’m efficient, da.” 😎

---

# 🕯️ 4. PSEE – Previous Smaller or Equal Element
This one…  
this is where my brain did a somersault.

**Meaning:**  
Find the element on the LEFT that is smaller or equal.

The first time I read that “or equal”…  
my brain:  
 “Ayoo extra condition ah? Already confuse pannitinga.” 😭

But guess what?  
Same stack principle.  
Same “pop until condition satisfies”.  
Same feeling of confidence when it finally works.

# 🧩 The Common Pattern (Your Aha Moment!)
If you understand this one paragraph,  
you’ve mastered all 4 problems:

- Go **left → right** or **right → left** based on which “next/previous” you need.  
- Maintain a **stack of candidates**.  
- While the top of the stack is **not useful**, pop it.  
- Whatever remains on the top = your answer.  
- Then push the current element.

Boom.  
You are now the Harvey Specter of stack problems. 😎🧠🔥

# 🎭 How It Felt When I Finally Understood This
First 2 days:  
 “What the hell is this? Why so many variants??” 🤬

Day 3:  
 “Oh…  
 so everything is the SAME problem with direction changes?!” 😭💡

Day 4:  
 “I am unstoppable.” 😎🔥

Day 5:  
 “Let me teach the world.” 🧘‍♂️✨

---

# 🎉 Why You MUST Learn This
Because stack pattern appears EVERYWHERE:

- Stock span problems 📈  
- Histogram area max 📊  
- Sliding windows  
- Monotonic stack questions  
- Leetcode 100+ problems  
- Interviews where the interviewer wants to test your brain’s pressure limits 😭

Learn this once.  
Your DSA graph goes **brrrr** 📈🔥

# 📝 End Note
I know blogs have been dropping a little slow lately…  
My bad da. Life is fast, but I’ll catch up. 😎✌️  
But when I come back, I come back with quality.  
Just like this stack masterpiece. 😂🔥

🔥 **Stay sharp. Stay stacked. Stay unstoppable.**
